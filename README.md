The application allows users to enter in a transaction name and transaction amount and then select whether or not to add or subtract the funds from their balence. A balence over time is displayed for the user on a line graph below their transaction list. Users are able to enter in transcations online or offline. Online, these are stored in a MongoDB. Offline, these are cached in an indexDB on the machine and then synced with the database once a connection is restored.
